            <description><![CDATA[<p>Chris at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com/technology/">LateNite</a> has updated the pricing for <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a> &amp; <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>79.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD79.99</strong>, <strong>USD79.99</strong>, <strong>CAD79.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>19.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD19.99</strong>, <strong>USD19.99</strong>, <strong>CAD19.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Their upcoming apps will have the same pricing model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>29.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD29.99</strong>, <strong>USD29.99</strong>, <strong>CAD29.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for example, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.</p>
<p>Transfer Toolbox is currently waiting for approval on the Mac App Store, but you can download from TestFlight.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox is currently on TestFlight, and will hopefully be submitted to the Mac App Store by the end of this week for review.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Following on from the interest in <a href="https://fcp.cafe">FCP Cafe</a>, Chris at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com/technology/">LateNite</a> has thrown together this site to be a new &quot;home page&quot; and community for professional editors using DaVinCi Resolve.</p>
<p>We want this site to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open:</strong> This site will remain open-source on GitHub for anyone to suggest pull requests</li>
<li><strong>Up-to-date &amp; Relevant:</strong> We want this site to always be up-to-date and relevant</li>
<li><strong>No bullshit:</strong> We want this site to be honest, truthful, useful and professional</li>
<li><strong>Community Driven:</strong> This isn't our site, it's &quot;owned&quot; by the professional DaVinci Resolve Community</li>
<li><strong>Modern:</strong> This site should work great on the latest browsers, including mobile</li>
<li><strong>Fast &amp; Clean:</strong> This site should load quickly, and be easy to navigate</li>
<li><strong>No analytics or user tracking:</strong> No cookies here!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is still very much a work-in-progress, and we'll be adding content gradually over the coming weeks and months.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this video series, Igor Riđanović will be demonstrating proof-of-concept OpenAI GPT and DaVinci Resolve integrations, starting with a virtual Resolve assistant.</p>
<p>Imagine having all the information you need right at your fingertips within Resolve itself. No more switching between Facebook, Blackmagic Forum, or other platforms. Just ask your questions directly in Resolve.</p>
<p>Igor would love to hear your thoughts on this integration. Are there other GPT AI use cases you'd like to see in Resolve?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a month old, but for those that might have missed it, there's an awesome YouTube video that showcases the Audio Design Desk v2.0 Beta.</p>
<p>Audio Design Desk is to audio software what Pro Tools was to the tape machine. It’s an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing the process of adding music and sound effects to picture and cutting down what can typically be a full day project to just a few minutes. It comes bundled with 75,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, using AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>DaVinci Resolve 18.5 Beta 4</strong> is out now!</p>
<p>Today, the release of the public beta 4 of DaVinci Resolve 18.5 was announced, boasting additional improvements to the prior DaVinci public beta, including enhanced control over subtitle export. This update ensures that only activated subtitles are included in the render, subsequently displayed on the export. The update also guarantees greater system stability when displaying clip handles in the color page, thereby facilitating a smoother grading process.</p>
<p>The software update brings several scripting API enhancements for track and timeline management. This allows users to write scripts to automate frequent functions, such as placing and replacing visual effects on the DaVinci Resolve timeline. The result is an accelerated post-production process with fewer errors.</p>
<p>For DaVinci Resolve Studio users, the beta release includes support for transcribing both traditional and simplified Mandarin. Moreover, it enhances vertical video resolution during remote monitoring, providing superior quality vision while securely streaming footage to an offsite director or client.</p>
<p>The update also introduces support for Blackmagic RAW 3.2, alongside numerous bug fixes and general performance and stability enhancements.</p>
<p>DaVinci Resolve 18.5 Beta 4 is now available as a free download.</p>
<p>You can download and learn more <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/davinci-resolve-and-fusion">here</a>.</p>
