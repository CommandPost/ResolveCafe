Resolve Cafe was thrown together by [Chris Hocking](https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite) at [LateNite Films](https://latenitefilms.com/technology/).

The origin story comes back to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1661729178826477569), where [Alex Gollner](https://twitter.com/Alex4D) tweeted that "fcp.co is no longer the Final Cut Pro watercoooler place", and Chris replied with "Screw it… I just registered [finalcutpro.tech](https://finalcutpro.tech). Let’s do this thing!".

Chris decided that FCP Cafe was a better name/domain, and as a result, that site was born.

[Julien Chichignoud](https://julien.chichignoud.com) then said to Chris that DaVinci Resolve is "definitely where the industry is going" - and here we are.

[Dan Svoboda](http://dansvoboda.com) also seemed to think it was a [good idea](https://twitter.com/DanSvoboda/status/1663278360691179526).
