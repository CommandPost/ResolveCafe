In this video series, Igor Riđanović will be demonstrating proof-of-concept OpenAI GPT and DaVinci Resolve integrations, starting with a virtual Resolve assistant.

Imagine having all the information you need right at your fingertips within Resolve itself. No more switching between Facebook, Blackmagic Forum, or other platforms. Just ask your questions directly in Resolve.

Igor would love to hear your thoughts on this integration. Are there other GPT AI use cases you'd like to see in Resolve?

### Tuesday 30th May 2023

Following on from the interest in [FCP Cafe](https://fcp.cafe){target="_blank"}, Chris at [LateNite](https://latenitefilms.com/technology/){target="_blank"} has thrown together this site to be a new "home page" and community for professional editors using DaVinCi Resolve.

We want this site to be:

- **Open:** This site will remain open-source on GitHub for anyone to suggest pull requests
- **Up-to-date & Relevant:** We want this site to always be up-to-date and relevant
- **No bullshit:** We want this site to be honest, truthful, useful and professional
- **Community Driven:** This isn't our site, it's "owned" by the professional DaVinci Resolve Community
- **Modern:** This site should work great on the latest browsers, including mobile
- **Fast & Clean:** This site should load quickly, and be easy to navigate
- **No analytics or user tracking:** No cookies here!

This is still very much a work-in-progress, and we'll be adding content gradually over the coming weeks and months.
