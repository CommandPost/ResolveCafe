# Wish List

This page is dedicated to keeping track of DaVinci Resolve feature requests, via our [GitHub issues site](https://github.com/CommandPost/ResolveCafe/issues){target="_blank"}.

To submit a new feature request, simply sign up for a free GitHub account and post an issue [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/ResolveCafe/issues){target="_blank"}.

We also keep track of the most popular feature requests, based on the amount of reactions the issues get.

In general, whenever posting a feature request to GitHub, we also submit feedback to the [Blackmagic Design Forums](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewforum.php?f=21&sid=f22b8d91290f36eb3cd987459d49f572){target="_blank"}.
