### Dehancer

**Dehancer** is the OFX plugin suite for film-like color grading and film effects in DaVinci Resolve. Dozens of real photographic and motion picture films with truly analogue controls. Film Grain, Bloom and Halation effects to complete the look. Complete native support of ACES pipeline.

Based on 30-years of film shooting and darkroom experience combined with scientific approach, nonlinear image processing, andâ€¦ a bit of alchemy, of course.
