### 30th May 2023

Following on from the interest in [FCP Cafe](https://fcp.cafe){target="_blank"}, Chris at [LateNite](https://latenitefilms.com/technology/){target="_blank"} has thrown together this site to be a new "home page" and community for professional editors using DaVinCi Resolve.

We want this site to be:

- **Open:** This site will remain open-source on GitHub for anyone to suggest pull requests
- **Up-to-date & Relevant:** We want this site to always be up-to-date and relevant
- **No bullshit:** We want this site to be honest, truthful, useful and professional
- **Community Driven:** This isn't our site, it's "owned" by the professional DaVinci Resolve Community
- **Modern:** This site should work great on the latest browsers, including mobile
- **Fast & Clean:** This site should load quickly, and be easy to navigate
- **No analytics or user tracking:** No cookies here!

This is still very much a work-in-progress, and we'll be adding content gradually over the coming weeks and months.
