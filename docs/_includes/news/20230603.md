In this video series, Igor Riđanović will be demonstrating proof-of-concept OpenAI GPT and DaVinci Resolve integrations, starting with a virtual Resolve assistant.

Imagine having all the information you need right at your fingertips within Resolve itself. No more switching between Facebook, Blackmagic Forum, or other platforms. Just ask your questions directly in Resolve.

Igor would love to hear your thoughts on this integration. Are there other GPT AI use cases you'd like to see in Resolve?
