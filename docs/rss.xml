            <description><![CDATA[<p>Following on from the interest in <a href="https://fcp.cafe">FCP Cafe</a>, Chris at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com/technology/">LateNite</a> has thrown together this site to be a new &quot;home page&quot; and community for professional editors using DaVinCi Resolve.</p>
<p>We want this site to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open:</strong> This site will remain open-source on GitHub for anyone to suggest pull requests</li>
<li><strong>Up-to-date &amp; Relevant:</strong> We want this site to always be up-to-date and relevant</li>
<li><strong>No bullshit:</strong> We want this site to be honest, truthful, useful and professional</li>
<li><strong>Community Driven:</strong> This isn't our site, it's &quot;owned&quot; by the professional DaVinci Resolve Community</li>
<li><strong>Modern:</strong> This site should work great on the latest browsers, including mobile</li>
<li><strong>Fast &amp; Clean:</strong> This site should load quickly, and be easy to navigate</li>
<li><strong>No analytics or user tracking:</strong> No cookies here!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is still very much a work-in-progress, and we'll be adding content gradually over the coming weeks and months.</p>
